# Book v Film

## Summary
A web app that allows users to search and compare books and films of the same title. After typing in a film/book title, users will see a side-by-side comparison of the film poster and book cover along with information on the director and the year each was produced. Users can then click a drop-down menu that reveals synopses and ratings.

## Motivation
As an avid book and movie watcher, I wanted there to be a simple way to compare film and book adaptions to their original source material.
